## Extensions:
extension 8 
Extension 9 

* Nice extension - does such and such.
i did extension number 8 , i used DFS with a modification so that i can make it work with fixed length and used in the implementation classes 
, i think it runs best for the time complexity as it's the minimal time complexity O((V+E) * fixed length ) which is still O(V+E) , the best to be

i did extension number 9 , i used classes to build UnionFind data structure , since the problem does suit the structure very well
as for the time complexity it's O(an) where a is a function that behave almost like a function ( inverse Ackermann function ) so i think it' best suited for this task

i used pytest-mock in the tes_main file to mock the command line

## Design

so i made each task in a file by itself and imported all the files in the main file . 
i used BFS with a bit of modification in the algorithm to support that the node are within maximal distance from one another . 
i think it was suited because the task needed a graph (also because i used DFS in task 8 and i love diversity : ) )
 

## Note 

you need to install pytest and pytest-mock in the test_main or in the project
